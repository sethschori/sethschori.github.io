My intention with this digital garden is to have a place to put information I learn and to build and share knowledge. Unlike blog posts, the entries in this learning garden won't be polished pieces of writing. In fact, if I'm successful at using my garden, there will always be incomplete entries because it will always be a work in progress. Given how blogs can often be oriented towards marketing and promotion, the temptation I'll try to avoid is worrying about how well something reads to others. In the garden, the primary audience is myself. However, posting it online will serve to share that information (and if I'm successful, knowledge) with others, as well as give me some accountability and connection in my learning journey.</p> <p>Some topics I may cultivate in my garden include: degrowth, post-capitalism, the solidarity economy, permaculture, and technology.</p> <p>My blog is currently a dozen technology-related articles from 2018-2019 when I was considering a career path in data science, so pretty dated stuff, but I figured I'd leave it as is.

I watched the first two videos of Kevin Markham's Data School video series about pandas. But, in order to get going with pandas I needed to install it. He recommends using the Anaconda distribution of Python which is supposed to have the easiest package installation (numpy, pandas, etc.). From what I've read online, the ease of installation argument is less important for Linux machines where you have admin privileges than for, say, Windows machines where you don't. However, I figured I'd go with the recommended distribution so I could eliminate potential problems and also because I may end up working on a Windows machine later on, so I'd prefer the cross-platform ease of installation of Anaconda. </p>","tags":["anaconda"]},{"location":"blog/2018/12/04/installing-anaconda-in-ubuntu/#the-path-variable-problem-that-tripped-me-up","title":"The PATH variable problem that tripped me up","text":"<p>I found installing Anaconda to be really easy. I just went to the installation page, chose the Installing on Linux option and followed the instructions, including verifying the MD5 hash.</p> <p>I followed the FAQ's advice and let the installer add the path to Anaconda to my system's PATH variable. This works fine from Anaconda's perspective, but it changes the default system Python to the version of Python installed with Anaconda. In other words, if you type <code>python</code> at the command line, you'll be running the version of python in the Anaconda directory instead of the default directory (in my case, <code>/usr/bin/python</code>).</p> <p>After way too much time trying to resolve this, the solution I stumbled on turned out to be very simple. Here's the code block that Anaconda added at the end of my <code>~/.bashrc</code> file:</p> <pre><code># added by Anaconda3 5.3.1 installer\n# &gt;&gt;&gt; conda init &gt;&gt;&gt;\n# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!\n__conda_setup=\"$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/home/seth/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2&gt; /dev/null)\"\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    \\eval \"$__conda_setup\"\nelse\n    if [ -f \"/home/seth/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\n        . \"/home/seth/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base\n    else\n        \\export PATH=\"/home/seth/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\nunset __conda_setup\n# &lt;&lt;&lt; conda init &lt;&lt;&lt;\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>\\export PATH=\"/home/seth/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"</code> prepends the Anaconda directory to the beginning of your PATH variable's existing values. This is great, except that it means that when the system looks for the Python binaries, it finds them in the Anaconda directory and stops looking there.</p> <p>The solution I came up with (thanks to Piotr Dobrogost's comment on this Stack Overflow question) is to add the default Python directory to the beginning of the PATH variable, prior to the Anaconda directory.</p> <p>To accomplish that, here's the extra two lines of code that I added after the Anaconda code block:</p> <pre><code># added by Anaconda3 5.3.1 installer\n# &gt;&gt;&gt; conda init &gt;&gt;&gt;\n# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!\n__conda_setup=\"$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/home/seth/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2&gt; /dev/null)\"\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    \\eval \"$__conda_setup\"\nelse\n    if [ -f \"/home/seth/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\n        . \"/home/seth/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base\n    else\n        \\export PATH=\"/home/seth/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\nunset __conda_setup\n# &lt;&lt;&lt; conda init &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n# add /usr/bin to beginning of PATH so that python, python3, python2 use default system python not Anaconda python \nexport PATH=\"/usr/bin:$PATH\"\n</code></pre> <p>Is there a better, cleaner solution than this? Probably. I notice that this solution ends up putting <code>/usr/bin</code> in my PATH variable twice, which doesn't seem great. But at the moment this seems to be working, so I'm writing it up as a solution to this problem that I ran into.</p>","tags":["anaconda"]},{"location":"blog/2018/12/04/installing-anaconda-in-ubuntu/#useful-commands","title":"Useful commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>echo $PATH</code> will print the contents of the PATH variable to the screen.

So I was curious  about whether I would need SQL in a data science career, or if pandas could  suffice.</p> <p>A quick search turned up this article about PostgreSQL vs. pandas. My takeaway is that, not surprisingly, the situation is more complex than  simply one tool always being better than the other. Instead, SQL is best  suited for certain tasks, and vice versa for pandas.</p> <p>In particular, SQL is faster for typical database tasks, such as joins.  Whereas pandas is better for complex operations like string manipulation or  statistics.</p> <p>While, in theory, you could do practically everything with either tool, it  wouldn't be the most performant solution (pandas and SQL are each faster at  certain tasks, under certain situations), nor the most desirable  solution (e.g. SQL is a lingua franca and compatible with lots of  programming languages, so pandas could be limiting in that regard).</p> <p>The article, titled \"PostgreSQL vs. pandas\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to balance tasks between  server and client side\", offers these ten rules of thumb for evaluating whether to use SQL or pandas  for an analytics task:</p> <ol> <li>If doing a task in SQL can cut the amount of data returned to the client  (e.g. filtering to a smaller subset of data), then the task belongs on the  server.</li> <li>If the amount of data returned to the client remains unchanged or grows  (e.g. adding complex calculated columns; cross-joins, etc.) by doing it in   SQL, the task belongs into client side code.</li> <li>Test different setups on the server and client side to see which is more  efficient. In the worst case, you\u2019ll learn something.</li> <li>Never do in code what the SQL server can do well for you: Data  extraction  (CRUD, joins and set operations) &amp; simple data analysis.</li> <li>If it\u2019s painful or ugly, do it in client-side code: Complex data analysis  belongs into code. Leave formatting or math for the client side. The database  exists mainly to facilitate fast extraction of data.</li> <li>Minimise SQL complexity: Split overly complex, non-performant queries.  Two simpler queries will save the headache of maintaining one mega-query.  Alternatively, split it into a simple query and handle the complexity in  client-side code.</li> <li>Minimise database round trips: Try to do as much as you can in one  operation. Every semicolon is one round trip and adds another I/O operation.</li> <li>Configure your database carefully e.g. for postgres.  Otherwise, you default to sub-optimal algorithms which is expensive.</li> <li>It\u2019s well worth investing time in database schema optimisation.</li> <li>Same goes for setting optimal foreign/sort/distribution keys and  properly normalised tables to maintain the integrity of data.</li> </ol> <p>I think the full article is a worthwhile read.</p>","tags":["pandas"]},{"location":"blog/2019/01/23/next-data-science-steps/","title":"Next Data Science Steps and What I've Been Up To Recently","text":"<p>I haven't blogged in about two weeks. Here's what I've been up to with  data science and programming recently.</p> <ul> <li> <p>I had a small but interesting consulting project with a client I've  previously worked with. It involved a proof of concept to read and write  records via the APIs of a proprietary CRM system. It was an opportunity for  me to work with OAuth (OAuth2, actually) for the first time. I was  pleasantly surprised by how the requests library (which I've used before and liked) has built-in OAuth2 support via the requests-oauthlib package  and this made it much easier to work with OAuth2 than I expected. </p> </li> <li> <p>Here are the details on requests' support for Web Application  Flow (which is the flow I needed to use for this project).</p> </li> <li>And here is an article  from Digital Ocean about the different types of OAuth2 flows which was recommended to me by someone with more OAuth2 experience than I  have.</li> </ul> <p>This was also a chance for me to work directly with the API,    as there isn't a library available that I'm aware of. In contrast, when    I've previously worked with Salesforce's APIs I used the    <code>simple_salesforce</code> Python package, which worked well and which I was    grateful for, but it did introduce a layer of abstraction that led to a    slightly more superficial understanding.</p> <ul> <li> <p>I had another helpful informational interview with a data scientist doing  machine learning. From this, I realized that I want to test whether I'm interested in machine learning, because that will influence my learning path. He recommended Andrew's Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course. I respect this person's recommendation because he has many years of  programming experience, completed a data science masters degree at a  prestigious university, and is working in the industry. Although the course  material is fairly old, he thinks that Andrew explains the material really  well. It's a 55-hour course (free!) and I've recently gotten started on it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, another client I've been assisting with work that's tangentially  related to programming has more directly involved me in programming.  I've been getting my toes wet with Ruby on Rails and it's my first time  working  with a production web app. It's been interesting trying to wrap my brain  around all the parts of a web app (still more to learn!) and to see how  things are set up at a startup where the founders are all accomplished  developers.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["meta data science"]},{"location":"blog/2019/01/23/web-scraping-embedded-json/","title":"Web scraping a site with embedded JSON","text":"<p>code snippet</p> <pre><code>def scrape_list():\n    \"\"\"Scrape the cleantech list and put companies into a list of dicts.\"\"\"\n    cleantech100_url = 'https://i3connect.com/gct100/the-list'\n    cleantech100_base_url = 'https://i3connect.com'\n    request = requests.get(cleantech100_url)\n    bs = BeautifulSoup(request.content, \"html.parser\")\n    table = bs.table\n    # The HTML table has the headers: COMPANY, GEOGRAPHY, FUNDING, SECTOR,\n    # YEAR FOUNDED\n    header = [\n        'cleantech_url',     # from COMPANY\n        'company_country',   # from GEOGRAPHY\n        'company_funding',   # from FUNDING\n        'company_sector',    # from SECTOR\n        'company_year_founded',  # from YEAR FOUNDED\n        'company_region',    # Column exists but is not displayed in the header.\n        'company_video'      # Column exists but is not displayed in the header.\n    ]\n    companies = []\n    for row in table.tbody.find_all('tr'):\n        company = {}\n        index = 0\n        if 'id' in row.attrs and row.attrs['id'] == 'gct-table-no-results':\n            # Last row of table should be skipped because it's just got this:\n            # &lt;tr id=\"gct-table-no-results\"&gt;\n            #               &lt;td colspan=\"7\"&gt;No results found.&lt;/td&gt;\n            continue\n        for cell in row.find_all('td'):\n            # co_key is the key to use within company dict,\n            # e.g. company[co_key] could point to company['cleantech_url']\n            co_key = header[index]\n            if cell.string is None:\n                # The first and last columns of the HTML table have no text\n                # (cell.string is None).\n                try:\n                    # The first column of the HTML table holds a link to the\n                    # company detail page.

Here are some of my takeaways mixed with my own thoughts:</p> <ul> <li>The circular economy contrasts with the linear economy, which is a one-way path that extracts resources, which are then used and thrown away. The circular economy tries to close loops (William McDonough\u2019s term \u201ccradle to cradle\u201d comes to mind). This can be done by making waste into resource inputs, both at the larger scale of manufacturing (I recall an actual business that uses waste coffee grounds to grow edible mushrooms), to the smaller scale of things like repair cafes.</li> <li>The doughnut or doughnut economy is Kate Raworth\u2019s term, illustrated below, which ties together meeting human needs across a dozen categories (avoiding shortfalls) while staying within nine types of ecological limits (avoiding overshoot). </li> <li>The article describes post-growth as an \u201capproach without a toolkit.\u201d Post-growth is the simple (and obvious) recognition that we can\u2019t endlessly expand production and consumption on a finite planet. As I\u2019ve been reading in more detail in Kohei Saito\u2019s  Slow Down, absolute decoupling (in which the economy grows while material consumption does not) is a nice concept to dream about, but is fantasy. Post-growth moves beyond seeking green technologies as the solution to our environmental problems to calling into question growth itself. (Green technologies, while certainly useful and important, will never be a sufficient solution to our environmental problems as long as we have endless growth.) I also think of post-growth as somewhat synonymous with the term \u201csteady-state economy.\u201d Both of these terms, to me, describe a future state that we intend to reach, but they don\u2019t describe how to get there.</li> <li>In contrast, degrowth is the \u201cagenda of action\u201d that can get us to the targets that the doughnut tool can define. I think of degrowth as a strategy, or agenda, for reaching a post-growth (or steady-state) economy. Unlike the other terms, degrowth brings in a critical component of justice instead of focusing solely on the environment. Jason Hickel and Kohei Saito both discuss the need to address the dramatic inequality between the Global North and the Global South. Hickel discusses increasing consumption and development in the Global South while decreasing production in the Global North of extractive and destructive production that\u2019s less necessary, such as fast fashion, industrial beef, McMansions, advertising, military armaments, planned obsolescence, food waste, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Circular economy, doughnut economy, post-growth, and degrowth can be complementary.
