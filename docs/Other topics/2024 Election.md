I invite you to join me in any, or all, of these ways that I'm taking action this election season.
## Donations

- Support the **Harris Walz campaign** at [kamalaharris.com](https://kamalaharris.com/)
- Support **Force Multiplier**'s House Impact Slate, Senate Slate, and Blue Surge Turnout Fund at [forcemultiplierus.org](https://www.forcemultiplierus.org/) 
	- Force Multiplier originally started in the Boston area. They're an all-volunteer group that provides donors with research-based recommendations on which races are most likely to affect the balance of power in the House + Senate.

## Phone banking

- Janelle Stelson, PA-10 — Call voters with Massachusetts’ own [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) to elect Pennsylvania Democrat Janelle Stelson to Congress, fire MAGA Republican Congressman Scott Perry, and Flip the House. Pennsylvania is a battleground state critical to defeating Trump. [Sign up for calling on Thursdays or Sundays](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/event/644234/)!

## Canvassing / Door knocking

- New Hampshire — I’m planning to join other Massachusetts volunteers for [door knocking in Nashua, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/636785/) or [door knocking in Manchester, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/634549/). I’ve heard that New Hampshire’s local and congressional races are important and not a sure thing, and that New Hampshire needs the help from Massachusetts volunteers.

## Other opportunities

I'm not directly involved in the following, but wanted to share these opportunities as well:

- **Phone banking with Swing Blue Alliance** — SBA has [additional phone banking opportunities for calling swing states](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/). 
- **Door knocking in swing states with Seed The Vote** — I've heard from a couple of people who are volunteering with [Seed The Vote](https://seedthevote.org/) in Nevada and Michigan. You can read [this blog post about a weekend volunteering with STV in Reno, Nevada](http://caelections.blogspot.com/2024/09/JK-Reno-STV.html) from someone I know. As Jeff writes:
  >STV most needs volunteers in the critical swing states of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, & Pennsylvania. We're knocking in all those states now through election day. For those who need financial support, STV can often help cover hotel & flight costs. To learn more, sign up for an [info session here](https://www.mobilize.us/seedthevote/event/595794/).
- **Letter writing with Vote Forward** —
