Here are ways that I'm taking action this election season:
## Donations
- The **Harris Walz campaign** at [kamalaharris.com](https://kamalaharris.com/)
- **Force Multiplier**'s House Impact Slate, Senate Slate, and Blue Surge Turnout Fund: [www.forcemultiplierus.org](https://www.forcemultiplierus.org/) 
	- Force Multiplier originally started in the Boston area. They're an all-volunteer group that provides donors with research based recommendations on which races are most likely to affect the balance of power in the House + Senate.
## Phone banking
- Janelle Stelson, PA-10 — Call voters with Massachusetts’ own [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) to elect Pennsylvania Democrat Janelle Stelson to Congress, fire MAGA Republican Congressman Scott Perry, and Flip the House. Pennsylvania is a battleground state critical to defeating Trump. [Sign up for calling on Thursdays or Sundays!](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/event/644234/)
## Canvassing

## Other opportunities
I'm not directly involved in the following, but wanted to share these as well:

- **Seed The Vote** - I've heard from a couple of people who are volunteering with [Seed The Vote](https://seedthevote.org/) in Nevada and Michigan. You can read [this blog post about a weekend volunteering with STV in Reno, Nevada](http://caelections.blogspot.com/2024/09/JK-Reno-STV.html) from someone I know. As Jeff writes:
  >STV most needs volunteers in the critical swing states of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, & Pennsylvania. We're knocking in all those states now through election day. For those who need financial support, STV can often help cover hotel & flight costs. To learn more, sign up for an [info session here](https://www.mobilize.us/seedthevote/event/595794/).
