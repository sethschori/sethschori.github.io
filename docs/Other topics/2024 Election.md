I invite you to join me in any, or all, of these ways that I'm taking action this election season!
## Donations

- Support the **Harris Walz campaign** at [kamalaharris.com](https://kamalaharris.com/)
- Support **Force Multiplier**'s House Impact Slate, Senate Slate, and Blue Surge Turnout Fund at [forcemultiplierus.org](https://www.forcemultiplierus.org/) 
	- Force Multiplier originally started in the Boston area. They're an all-volunteer group that provides donors with research-based recommendations on which races are most likely to affect the balance of power in the House + Senate.

## Phone banking

- Janelle Stelson, PA-10 — Call voters with Massachusetts’ own [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) to elect Pennsylvania Democrat Janelle Stelson to Congress, fire MAGA Republican Congressman Scott Perry, and Flip the House. Pennsylvania is a battleground state critical to defeating Trump. [Sign up for calling on Thursdays or Sundays](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/event/644234/)!

## Canvassing / Door knocking

- New Hampshire — I’m planning to join other Massachusetts volunteers for [door knocking in Nashua, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/636785/) or [door knocking in Manchester, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/634549/). I’ve heard that New Hampshire’s local and congressional races are important and not a sure thing, and that New Hampshire needs the help from Massachusetts volunteers.

## Other opportunities

I'm not directly involved in the following, but wanted to share these opportunities as well:

- **Go door knocking in swing states with Seed The Vote** — I've heard from a couple of people who are volunteering with [Seed The Vote](https://seedthevote.org/) in Nevada and Michigan. You can read [this blog post about a weekend volunteering with STV in Reno, Nevada](http://caelections.blogspot.com/2024/09/JK-Reno-STV.html) from someone I know. As Jeff writes:
  >STV most needs volunteers in the critical swing states of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, & Pennsylvania. We're knocking in all those states now through election day. For those who need financial support, STV can often help cover hotel & flight costs. To learn more, sign up for an [info session here](https://www.mobilize.us/seedthevote/event/595794/).
- **Join a phone bank with Swing Blue Alliance** — SBA has [additional phone banking opportunities for calling swing states](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/). 
- **Write some letters with Vote Forward** — Vote Forward is aiming to send 10 million letters this year. Since 2018, their 269,000 volunteers have sent 35.5 million letters, which have been shown to boost turnout by up to 3.4%. Their nonpartisan arm encourages potential voters to register to vote and increase participation of historically underrepresented communities. Their 501(c)(4) arm helps increase voter turnout in political campaigns. I’ve sent letters with them in the past and you don’t need fancy supplies, other than stamps, envelopes, and access to a printer. Learn more and sign up at [votefwd.org](https://votefwd.org/).
