From Jason Hickel’s blog post, [A response to Pollin and Chomsky: We need a Green New Deal without growth](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/10/19/we-need-a-green-new-deal-without-growth):

>Growth is ultimately a kind of propaganda term; it takes processes of extraction, commodification and elite accumulation, which are quite often destructive to human communities and to ecology, and sells them as natural, good and common-sense (who could possibly be against growth?). The language of growth is the bedrock of capitalism’s cultural hegemony.
