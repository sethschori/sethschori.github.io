Jason Hickel’s [Degrowth and MMT: A thought experiment](https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/9/10/degrowth-and-mmt-a-thought-experiment) blog post has this succinct definition of degrowth:

> Degrowth has two parts: an ecology part and a social justice part. It seeks to (a) reduce excess resource and energy use (specifically in high-income nations) in order to bring the economy back into balance with the living world, and (b) to do so while at the same time reducing inequality and improving people’s access to the things they need to live long, healthy, flourishing lives.
