## Phone Banks Post-Election Day: “Cure” Absentee Ballots
This election will be very close and every vote must be counted. Vote/ballot curing is the process of helping voters who have had their absentee ballot rejected by their local clerk for an issue with the signature or address. If these voters don’t take steps to fix or “cure” their ballots, their votes will not be counted! You will call these voters to inform them of the problem and guide them to cure their ballot.

- [“Red Wave” Redux: Are GOP Polls Rigging the Averages in Trump’s Favor?](https://newrepublic.com/article/187425/gop-polls-rigging-averages-trump): Polling by right-leaning firms has exploded this cycle. It could be that they’re trying to create a (false) sense of momentum for Donald Trump.
- [Our Elections Are Not Fragile](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/our-elections-are-not-fragile): This article from the Brennan Center highlights two large trends in our elections. First, election deniers have ramped up their attacks. Second, despite these attacks, our election system is stronger than it was in 2020 and better equipped to repel these attacks.
- [5 Days Out I Would Much Rather Be Us Than Them - New 2024 Election Analysis and Video With Tom Bonier](https://www.hopiumchronicles.com/p/i-would-much-rather-be-us-than-them-aec) analysis from the Hopium Chronicles, excerpts:
    >R\[epublican]s would only be working so hard to shape the national narrative to make it look like Trump is winning if they believed he wasn’t.
    >Dems are matching our 2020 results in the battlegrounds despite the current battleground electorate being older, whiter, more male and more rural than at this point in 2020. This is really good. Next, as we expect both the R\[epublican] and unaffiliated vote to be more Democratic this time, it is very likely we are today running ahead of 2020 in the 7 battleground states. This too is really good.
