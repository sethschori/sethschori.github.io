## Phone Banks for “Curing” Absentee Ballots
This election will be very close and every vote must be counted. Vote/ballot curing is the process of helping voters who have had their ballot rejected by their local clerk for an issue with the signature or address on their absentee ballot. If these voters do not take steps to fix or “cure” their ballots, their votes will not be counted! You will call these voters to inform them of the problem and guide them to cure their ballot.

White communities, organized by MAGA forces, are in the way of us winning on every issue we care about.
