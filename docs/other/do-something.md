# Do Something with Rina & Seth
Action is the best antidote to anxiety. That's why Seth & Rina are hosting an election-related party: to influence the election and be in community together to nourish our democracy. 

- Sunday, October 27th, 1:30 - 5:00 PM (see below for what will happen when)
- Location in Arlington will be provided after you RSVP

PLEASE RSVP at this link (it'll help if you read the rest of this post first). We need a good estimate of the number of people by Fri Oct 25th, so we make sure to have enough materials and refreshments.
## Phone Banking (1:30-4:00)
We will join a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee to make calls for Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot in swing states. These days, phone banks use Zoom plus your phone, the Scale To Win autodialer (the best one!) to make the most efficient use of your time, and a script and instructions provided by the campaign. We're not expert phonebankers or trainers. **So if you plan to phone bank, please:**
- Show up by 1:40 to get a seat, connect to WiFi, make sure your Zoom is up to date, etc.
- Bring your own smartphone, laptop, and headphones  
- Register directly with the DNC by [signing up here](https://events.democrats.org/event/569897/) for the Oct 24th shift from 2-4 PM.
- We encourage you to have done a previous phonebank ([Wednesdays 5-6:30pm](https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/676346/) or [Saturdays 1-3pm](https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/623038/), or [Sundays 1-2:30pm](https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/652115/))! The more you do, the more you'll enjoy it!
- If the 26th is your first phonebank, there _will_ be on online training that will take 45min or so
## Letter Writing (2:00-4:00)
## Democracy Happy Hour (4:00-5:00)
