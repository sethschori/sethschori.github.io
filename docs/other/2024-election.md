# 2024 Election

Here are some ways to take action this election:
## Donate

- Donate to the **Harris Walz campaign** at [kamalaharris.com](https://kamalaharris.com/)
- Donate to [**Movement Voter Project** PAC](https://movement.vote/) to help move millions in funding to local grassroots groups turning out the hardest-to-reach voters who can tip the scales in the places that matter most.
- Support **Force Multiplier**'s House Impact Slate, Senate Slate, and Blue Surge Turnout Fund at [forcemultiplierus.org](https://www.forcemultiplierus.org/). They're an all-volunteer group that provides donors with research-based recommendations on which races are most likely to affect the balance of power in the House + Senate. NOTE: They do not screen candidates on issues.

## Take action

- Visit [**Swing Blue Alliance**](https://swingbluealliance.org/) — SBA is the largest all-volunteer, Democratic grassroots organization headquartered in Massachusetts. They have all kinds of actions — phone banking, canvassing, texting, postcarding, letter writing, etc. — so you can find what works best for you. 
	- Janelle Stelson, PA-10 — Call voters with Massachusetts’ own [Swing Blue Alliance](https://swingbluealliance.org/) to elect Pennsylvania Democrat Janelle Stelson to Congress, fire MAGA Republican Congressman Scott Perry, and Flip the House. Pennsylvania is a battleground state critical to defeating Trump. [Sign up for calling on Thursdays or Sundays](https://www.mobilize.us/swingbluealliance/event/644234/)!
- New Hampshire — Join other Massachusetts volunteers for [door knocking in Nashua, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/636785/) or [door knocking in Manchester, NH](https://www.mobilize.us/massdems/event/634549/). I’ve heard that New Hampshire’s local and congressional races are important and not a sure thing, and that New Hampshire needs the help from Massachusetts volunteers.
	- Chris Messinger (formerly with TASC) is organizing folks to door knock in Congressional District 2 where there’s no incumbent. Most door knocked on behalf of Maggie Goodlander. This is organized out of someone’s house and going to Salem, Windham, Pelham. They’re really grateful to have the support of volunteers from Massachusetts. This is a much more red district than Manchester, so probably more useful.
- **Join Bend the Arc** for remote volunteering opportunities:
	- Reach out to voters in Wisconsin to do non-partisan vote planning before the November election. Sundays in October/November. [Details and sign up here](https://www.mobilize.us/bendthearc/event/686040/).
	- Join Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and One Arizona to call voters in the state before the general election. [Details and sign up here](https://www.mobilize.us/bendthearc/event/689796/).
	- Jews for Kamala Harris Phonebank — [details and sign up](https://www.mobilize.us/bendthearc/event/687109/).
- **Go door knocking in swing states with Seed The Vote** — I've heard from a couple of people who are volunteering with [Seed The Vote](https://seedthevote.org/) in Nevada and Michigan. You can read [this blog post about a weekend volunteering with STV in Reno, Nevada](http://caelections.blogspot.com/2024/09/JK-Reno-STV.html) from someone I know. As Jeff writes:
  >STV most needs volunteers in the critical swing states of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, & Pennsylvania. We're knocking in all those states now through election day. For those who need financial support, STV can often help cover hotel & flight costs. To learn more, sign up for an [info session here](https://www.mobilize.us/seedthevote/event/595794/).
- **Write letters with Vote Forward** — Vote Forward is aiming to send 10 million letters this year. Since 2018, their 269,000 volunteers have sent 35.5 million letters, which have been shown to boost turnout by up to 3.4%. Their nonpartisan arm encourages potential voters to register to vote and increase participation of historically underrepresented communities. Their 501(c)(4) arm helps increase voter turnout in political campaigns. I’ve sent letters with them in the past and you don’t need fancy supplies, other than stamps, envelopes, and access to a printer. Learn more and sign up at [votefwd.org](https://votefwd.org/).
- **Join non-partisan or partisan text banking**: registration and get out the vote text banking. Exercise your rights text banking.
	- Next Gen Voters - [organizing.nextgenamerica.org](https://organizing.nextgenamerica.org/) 
	- Field Team 6 (a consortium of groups) - [www.fieldteam6.org](https://www.fieldteam6.org/)
	- Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly called NARAL) - [reproductivefreedomforall.org](https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/)
